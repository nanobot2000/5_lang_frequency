You have to start program, run the script with the `-f`, `--filepath` argument with path to text file and optional `-n`, `--number` argument (default 10).\n
To call the help, run the script with the `-h` or `--help` option.\n

```bash
$ python3 lang_frequency.py -h
usage: lang_frequency.py [-h] -f FILEPATH [-n NUMBER]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILEPATH, --filepath FILEPATH
                        full path to text file
  -n NUMBER, --number NUMBER
